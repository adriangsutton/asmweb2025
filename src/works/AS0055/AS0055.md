<b>Programme note</b>

A short time-lapse of an English garden.. from the end of winter to the beginning of summer, in two joined movements.

<b>1. Awakening</b>

Imagine a microscope zoomed in on the interior of a plant stem â€“ frozen, dormant in deepest winter. The first signs of life start to emerge.. tiny, fragile and delicate at first. As the sap begins to rise, the structures of the plant begin to bond, lengthen and strengthen, with the sun warming more each day.

<b>2. Burst</b>

Summer arrives. The garden is transformed into an energetic dance of colour, growth and variety.

The original version of this piece was a commission from the violinist Fenella Humphreys in 2021, scored for violin, accordion, percussion and double bass.
