<b>Programme note</b>

I'm not an American, but perhaps this piece is me pretending to be one - at the turn of the 20th century in the rural midwest.

Much of my music is concerned with lines, and how they interact.
 
On seeing a particularly impressive long-lens photo of mountains in Montana, I was struck by the same thing: multiple jagged and serrated outlines of the peaks, rising and falling and set in silhouetted relief against each other.
