<b>Programme note</b>

This anthem was commissioned for the 2014 War Horse Prom as a companion to the original 2010 War Horse Suite used in that Prom concert. The original brief was to write, very unusually, for a mix of young baritone and ‘cambiata’ voices — male voices that have begun to change and deepen. This was to memorialise those young men who, though still in their teens, were sent to fight for their country. It is an anthem to the lost.

In the libretto, these fallen soldiers are imagined as guardian angels, timeless and prophetic as they guard against conflicts old and new. Their constant warning is to step back from the brink of war, and they plead with us to play our part in that.

A fluttering in muted strings sets the stage. This busy rhythm will be an almost constant thread to the piece, either gently accompanying or driving the material urgently forwards. The angels present themselves in voices half whispered, half sung.

There is deft word-painting throughout: the descending phrase of sleep, the rattle of the drum on the battlefield, the lament of graves overgrown, the snap pizzicato of bricks being splintered, the fanfares of the march in the chorus. Every phrase is full of detail.

A solo voice in the middle section reminds us that ‘today the lines are drawn again,’ and the music briefly becomes more reflective before building to the angels’ desperate cry to learn from the past.
    
A brief quote of the opening theme in the strings turns the page for the final prophecy, and the music ends on a note of defiant hope.

<b>Text</b>

Some see us<br>
As birds wheeling against the white<br>
As sun spearing through the cloud<br>
Or as the deep breath before sleep<br>
<br>
We are your guardians<br>
The sons and daughters you never had<br>
We are the deflected bullet<br>
The hide-out unfound<br>
The bridge, the kindling<br>
The message that got through<br>
<br>
We rewrite the rules<br>
We are prophecy retold<br>
We set the march to a different beat<br>
And watch as your world unfolds<br>
And watch as your world unfolds<br>
<br>
Some see us<br>
In faces fading into the black<br>
Their eyes holding still your gaze<br>
Yet with their graves overgrown<br>
<br>
But we are your angels<br>
The wheel re-spun, the chances you can take<br>
We are your eyes to the past<br>
The picture recoloured<br>
Unfaded, and unframed<br>
The anthems sung anew<br>
<br>
We rewrite the rules<br>
We are prophecy retold<br>
We set the march to a different beat<br>
And watch as your world unfolds<br>
And watch as your world unfolds<br>
<br>
Today the lines are drawn again<br>
In gas, in oil and water<br>
The spoils divided and lives reshuffled<br>
And lots are cast by the few<br>
<br>
Today mothers scavenge for weeds<br>
Under siege of sniper fire<br>
Today the fields are scorched tar-black<br>
Your homes splintered into bricks and blood<br>
<br>
We are your forefathers<br>
The sons and daughters you may never have<br>
Our voices raw and hoarse<br>
Can you not hear?<br>
Draw back! Step down!<br>
<br>
This will not end<br>
This will not end until<br>
<br>
You rewrite the rules<br>
You retell the prophecy<br>
You set the march to a different beat<br>
So new tales can be told<br>
So new tales can be told<br>
<br>
