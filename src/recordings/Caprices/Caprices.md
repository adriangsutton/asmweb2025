This disc features <I>Pagvar</I>, Adrian's contribution to Fenella Humphreys' <i>Caprices</i> project, which was to get contemporary composers to write responses to Paganini's 24 Caprices.

<hr>

"...a seriously entertaining disc...Humphreys is technically and musically superb, and captured in a clear and focused sound." <i><small>â€” Tim Homfray, The Strad</small></i>
