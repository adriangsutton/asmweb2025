<b>Soloist:</b> <a href="https://www.fenellahumphreys.com">Fenella Humphreys</a>

<b>BBC Philharmonic Orchestra</b> conducted by <b>Michael Seal</b>

<hr>

"..soaring, searing, passionately lyrical writing ..a great showcase for a remarkable talent, and living proof that serious, substantial music of the tonal and melodic variety can still (_mirabile dictu_) be found in an original and individual voice." 
<i><small>— Jeremy Nicholas, Gramophone Magazine</small></i>

"… Humphreys, Seal and the BBC Philharmonic have its [Violin Concerto] linguistic number. Humphreys brings to her endlessly unfurling violin lines a taut, silvery weightlessness. The recording beautifully captures her duets with woodwind, and a tremendous dynamic range." <i><small>— Charlotte Gardner, The Strad</small></i>

"Fenella Humphreys is a fearless soloist, golden-toned in the lyrical central movement and athletic in the faster sections. Beautifully scored and well-proportioned.." <i><small>— Graham Rickson, The Arts Desk</small></i>

"..sweet lyricism and spruce rhythms.. top-notch performances" <i><small>— Colin's Column</small></i>

"..an engaging, satisfying and thoughtful disc" <i><small>— Robert Hugill, Planet Hugill</small></i>
